# DHT22-Thermometer

This thermometer idea came to me when my little sister asked me “Vince, what’s the temperature?”. Answering I said, “Well, I’ll look it up.” So I looked it up but that wasn’t enough for her, this continued for a few days. She then wanted the humidity as well as the temperature, so I decided to build a 'meter' that she could use whenever she wanted the to see the temperature or humidity readings in real time accuracy. This is the result.

For the full guide on how to build it have a look here: https://www.vjs3d.cc/projects/thermometer/
